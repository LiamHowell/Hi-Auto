Combine with a 4G HAT or phone (+ some more AI goodness) to make your own kinda locally hosted Assistant.

Required folders:
/recorded_audio - to store the user audio
/playback_audio - to store files to play to the user

1. Create a file "secrets.py" based off the "ex_secrets.py", and update the OpenAI API Key.
2. Should be good to go from there? Might want to generate a few lines with TTS
